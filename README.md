Inline Regex Editor for Brackets
================================
For those times when you need to [swoop in and save the day with a regular expression](https://xkcd.com/208/).

Just put your cursor on a regular expression literal and press Ctrl+E to bring up the editor. Enter test strings and see matches
in real time as you edit the regexp.

Displays regular expressions with full colored syntax highlighting, and highlights matching parentheses (intelligently ignoring
escaped characters).
