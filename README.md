Inline Regex Editor for Brackets
================================
Inline regular expression editor for JavaScript code: enter test strings and see matches in real time as you edit the regexp.
Just put your cursor on a regular expression literal and press Ctrl+E to bring up the editor.

Displays regular expressions with full colored syntax highlighting, and highlights matching parentheses (intelligently ignoring
any escaped ones) when the cursor is next to one.
